/* 

Task 2: Working with switch statements and loops 
  
    Imagine you're creating a racing video game, and you need to display
    the results of each race. There are 8 racers and therefore 8 places 
    in each race. The places need to be displayed as abbreviated 
    ordinal numbers â€” 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc.
    
    1. Using a for loop and a switch statement, console.log 
       the places with abbreviated ordinal numbers from 1 to 8. 
    2. Check that your results appear as follow: 
        
        1st place
        2nd place
        3rd place
        4th place
        5th place
        6th place
        7th place
        8th place
