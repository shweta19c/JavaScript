    Task:
    
        1. Inside the function body, set up two variables called 
           'condition1' and 'condition2'.
        2. 'condition1' needs to hold a boolean which is true if 
           the 'word' parameter is of the data type of string 
           AND has a length of 2 or more.
        3. 'condition2' needs to hold a boolean which is true if 
           the 'letterToMatch' parameter is of the data type of 
           string AND has a length of exactly 1.
        4. Wrap the rest of the logic in the function in an if 
           statement so it only executes if BOTH 'condition1' AND 
           'condition2' are true.
        5. Add an else statement that logs out "Please pass in 
           correct arguments." if condition1 and condition2 don't 
           both return true.
        
        Expected output when letterFinder is called with 'test' and 't':

            ---No match found at index 1
            ---No match found at index 2
            Found letter t at index 3
        
        Expected output when letterFinder is called with [6, 7] and 't':
        
            Please pass in correct arguments
