/* Challenge

    Imagine you're creating an app that helps children practice the multiplication tables. You need to create a list of all of the multiplications for the numbers 1 to 10. 
    
    Task: 
        - Use a nested loop to console log the multiplications for each table, in ascending order,    displaying each multiplication as a string. 
        - At the start of each table, console log a string that says which number the table is for.

    Expected Results: 
    
        "----- 1 Times Table ----- "
        "1 times 1 equals 1"             
        "1 times 2 equals 2"
        "1 times 3 equals 3"
        "1 times 4 equals 4"
        "1 times 5 equals 5"
        "1 times 6 equals 6" 
        "1 times 7 equals 7"
        "1 times 8 equals 8"
        "1 times 9 equals 9"     
        "1 times 10 equals 10"      
         "----- 2 Times Table ----- "     
        "2 times 1 equals 2"
        "2 times 2 equals 4"
        "2 times 3 equals 6"
        "2 times 4 equals 8"
        etc...
*/ 

for(var i = 1; i <=10; i++){
    console.log("------"+ i+" times table------");
    for(var j =1; j <=10; j++){
        console.log(i + " times " + j +" equals: " , i * j);
    }
    console.log("\n");
}

/* Challenge

    Imagine the app also allows children to practice custom tables â€” for examples, multiples of 10 in descended order, each one divided by 5 and 10. 
    
    Task: 
        - Use a nested loop to console log each of the divisions for each of the multiples between 
          100 and 10, in the following format. 

    Expected Results: 
    
        "100 divided by 5 equals 20"
        "100 divided by 10 equals 10"
        "90 divided by 5 equals 18"
        "90 divided by 10 equals 9"
        "80 divided by 5 equals 16"
        "80 divided by 10 equals 8"
        etc...
        "10 divided by 10 equals 1 "

for(var i = 100; i >=10; i= i-10){
    for(var j = 5; j <= 10; j = j+5){
        console.log(i + " divided by " + j + " equals to: ", i/j);
    }
}
