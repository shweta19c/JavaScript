    I.  Give the cat a name 
        1. Declare a petCat variable and assign a name for the cat to it.
        2. Console.log the variable to make sure it has been declared correctly. 
        3. Use concatenation to console log the message: "My pet cat's name
           is: [your cat's name]."
           
    II. Create a sound for the cat. 
        4. Declare a catSound variable and assign a string for the cat's sound 
           to that variable. 
        5. Console.log the following message: "[Your cat's name] says [your cat's 
           sound]." Use commas, your two variables, and a string to create the message.    

    III. Change the sound of the cat.
         6. Reassign a new sound to the catSound variable.
         7. Console.log the following message: "[Your cat's name] now says [your cat's 
            sound]." Use commas, both variables, and a string to create the message.
